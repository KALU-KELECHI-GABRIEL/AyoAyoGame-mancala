# AyoAyoGame-mancala
A project to test my understanding of game theory, and decision theory.

This project is a simple mancala game written in JavaFx. I wrote this project back in February 2015.

Your are free to use the code or build upon it, all I ask is that you at least give attribution to the author [ my humble self :) ]
